# Applied Math Lab (Python)

Computational mathematics laboratory focused on:

- Dynamical systems
- Scientific modeling
- Artificial Intelligence (from first principles)
- Mathematical programming
- Reproducible computational research

---

## Vision (2026–2030)

Build a rigorous portfolio in applied mathematics combining:

- Mathematical foundations
- Scientific computing
- Research methodology
- Progressive integration toward AI and robotics

---

## Structure

This repository serves as a central hub for structured learning and research projects.

Projects are organized progressively:

- Foundations
- Numerical methods
- Dynamical systems
- Probability & statistics
- Machine learning (from scratch)
- Mathematical modeling

---

## Standards

Every project in this lab must include:

1. Clear problem statement
2. Mathematical formulation
3. Implementation
4. Reproducible execution
5. Results and discussion
6. Future extensions
