# Roadmap (Feb–Aug 2026)

## Goal
Build a reproducible applied-math portfolio in Python, progressing from fundamentals to modeling, dynamical systems, and ML from scratch.

## Feb (Setup + habits)
- GitHub/Git workflow: commits, branches (basic), pull requests (basic)
- Repo structure + templates
- Python basics: functions, modules, clean code
- First mini-projects in `00-foundations`

## Mar (Scientific Python basics)
- Numpy fundamentals (arrays, broadcasting)
- Matplotlib basics (clear figures)
- Simple data handling (CSV)
- Start `01-numerical-methods` basics

## Apr (Numerical methods)
- Root finding (bisection, Newton)
- Numerical integration (trapezoid, Simpson)
- ODE solvers (Euler, RK4)
- Validation against known solutions

## May (Dynamical systems)
- Discrete maps (logistic map)
- ODE systems (Lotka–Volterra)
- Stability intuition (qualitative + simulation)

## Jun (Probability & simulation)
- Monte Carlo estimation
- Noise + uncertainty in models
- Simple inference ideas (estimation, error)

## Jul (ML from scratch)
- Linear regression (closed form + gradient descent)
- Logistic regression (binary classification)
- Metrics + train/validation split

## Aug (Mini-capstone)
- Fit a dynamical model to synthetic noisy data
- Report + figures + reproducible run instructions
